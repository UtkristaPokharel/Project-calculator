Calculator Project

This is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features

* Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
* Handles decimal numbers.
* Includes clear (C) and all clear (AC) buttons.

Files

* index.html: Contains the HTML structure of the calculator.
* style.css: Defines the visual styles of the calculator elements.
* script.js: Implements the JavaScript logic for handling button clicks, updating the display, and performing calculations.
  
Running the Calculator

1. Save the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the same directory.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
   
How it Works

The calculator utilizes HTML to define the basic structure and layout of the buttons and screen. 
CSS styles the appearance of the buttons and screen. JavaScript handles user interactions with the buttons and performs calculations.

* Clicking a number button updates the current number displayed on the screen.
* Clicking a function button (+, -, *, /) sets the current operator and stores the previous number if available.
* Clicking the equal button performs the calculation based on the stored operator and current number.
* The clear (C) button removes the last digit from the current number.
* The all clear (AC) button resets all calculator state (current number, previous number, operator).

Additional Notes

* This is a basic calculator and does not include advanced features like memory functions or scientific calculations.
* Error handling is implemented for division by zero.


I hope this README provides a clear understanding of the calculator project!
